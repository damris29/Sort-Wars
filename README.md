# Sort-Wars
This app lets you see how Bubble Sort and Merge Sort work by sorting a list of movies. You can sort the movies by title, director, rating, duration, or release date and watch how each algorithm arranges them step by step. It’s a fun, visual way to compare how these two sorting methods handle the same data.
